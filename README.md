# Data Analysis & Visualization Web Application
## Technologies used:
Python : Programming Language

Django: For web based app

Pandas: For data analysis

ChartJS: For data visualisation

## Tools used:
Visual Studio Code

## Project description:
This application will create visualization charts by reading data from a raw CS file in a predefined format. As this is a 
web application, I use Django as a platform to build the entire application. I first download and install Django on my 
computer before I can start working on this application. This Django application will read data from a CV file that the 
user has provided. In order to manipulate and analyse the data, I have converted the CSV data into a pandas data 
frame. I then render out this data in a tabular format on an HTML page. I also use pandas to analyze the data, after
which I input the results into a Django framework and present them as charts for data visualization. I make use of a
library called as ChartS to display data on our webpage.

Hence, I have integrated multiple technologies like Django, Pandas, Chart/S together in order to create a functional 
web application.
